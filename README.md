### Environment:
A `Dockerfile` is provided with all the necessary environment configurations. In order to build and run it you may use the following commands:

```
docker build -t lungnetenv .
docker run --name LungNet -it --rm -v "$PWD":/home lungnetenv /bin/bash
```

Some notes:
- the `--name` sets a name for the container for identification reasons.
- the `-it` flag denotes that the container will be interactive.
- the `--rm` flags means that when the container is stopped the container will also be deleted (i.e. docker start LungNet cannot be used). 
- the `-v` flag mounts the $PWD (current) directory of the host machine in the `/home` of the container (guest).

In order for GPU support the flag `--runtime=nvidia` can be used. For older versions of nvidia drivers the `nvidia-docker` should be used.

After the successful excecution of the `docker build` and `docker run` commands, a bash promt from within the docker container will be available.

### How to use:
There are three scripts with a `__main__` method:

1. `get_fmd_db.py`: This script will download a test database and generate a training and validation datasets. These will be saved in `.npz` format
2. `train.py`: This script will generate a model and train it using the two data files (`fmd-train.npz`, `fmd-val.npz`) generated from the `get_fmd_db.py`
3. `test.py`: This script loads a model and passes a sample through. *(Note: the directory of the model and weights should be defined in the file beforehand)*

Using the bash promt of the container these commands could be used:

```
#/ python get_fmd_db.py
#/ python train.py
#/ python test.py
```

***Important Note:** The demo uses the [Flickr Material database](https://people.csail.mit.edu/celiu/CVPR2010/FMD/) for demontration reasons, no particular efforts were made for the optimization of the network for this task.* 

### Output:
The execution generates a folder for each run, which contains a `.png` file with the architecute of the CNN a log file with the metrics that were used along with the best snapshots of the model while training. The training loss and accuracy are also shown during training.
